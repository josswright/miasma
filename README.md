miasma
======

A multitrack sound randomizer designed to create and play ever-changing environmental soundscapes. It is written in Python with a simple CLI interface that allows changing the parameters of a running soundscape, as well as playing predefined soundscapes.

In miasma, sounds are added to tracks that are defined with a variety of randomization options to control repetition, looping, fading, and other features. This allows the creation of an ongoing, continually changing background noise useful as an audio backdrop without the distraction of music.

A good source for sounds to use in making soundscapes is http://www.freesound.org

In its current form, miasma is only usable with considerable source code tinkering.
